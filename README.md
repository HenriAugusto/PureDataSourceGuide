# my-pure-data-source-studies
This is some notes i wrote while studying PD's source. Right know it's NOT intended to be something read by others but in the future i have plans to suggest a development guide

## Classes and Objects

PD is written in C so there is no classes like you would find in C++ or Java for example.

PD's graphical objects are named **t_gobj** (m_pd.h)
